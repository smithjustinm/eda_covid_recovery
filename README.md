# milwaukee_data
The clearest data for this type of project is from the American Community Survey (ACS) data from the Census Bureau. The ACS 5-year data provides a detailed look into neighborhood data through small areas called census tracts. First, I will focus on a larger picture of Milwaukee County that distinguishes between the various cities and towns in the county of Milwaukee. After mapping the county, I will focus on neighborhoods that have the most segregated populations.


The data were obtained from the NHGIS
